My repo for Advent of Code

The folder structure is sorted by year, then day of problem.

| Year | Language                                      |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 2020 | Rust                                          |
| 2021 | TypeScript (using [Deno](https://deno.land/)) |

## Setup script

There is a setup script included with the repo. This setup script will create a new day folder, bootstrap it with input file reading code and some tests. The cool thing about this setup script is that it will pick a random language (unless a language is specified) and will create bootstrap code and tests in that language. Check it out in the `utils` folder.
